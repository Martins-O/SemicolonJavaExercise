//(The Sum of a Series) Find the summation of the sequence of numbers 1, 2, 3 â€¦ n, where
//        n ranges from 1 to 100. Use type long. Display the results in a tabular format that shows n and the
//        corresponding sum. If this were a product instead of a sum, what difficulty might you encounter
//        with the variable that accumulates the product?
